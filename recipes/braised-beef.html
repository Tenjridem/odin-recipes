    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"If you're looking for the perfect comfort food that's also worthy of company, give this braised beef recipe a try," culinary producer and recipe creator Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom) says.</p>
    <p>Braising is a cooking method that involves slowly cooking meat in a covered pot with some sort of liquid. In the case of this recipe, chuck roast is braised in a mixture of beef broth and red wine. Braising is similar to stewing, but it requires less liquid.</p>
    <h2>Nicole's Braised Beef Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <p>"This is one of the best things I've made in a long time," Nicole says. That's high praise! Here are a few beef braising tips and tricks from the expert:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When it comes to cutting the beef, Nicole says the smaller the better. When there's less surface area to brown, it's easier to get the meat evenly seared.</li>
        <li>Nicole likes using a chuck roast for this recipe because it's super moist and tender. Plus, it can endure the long cooking time.</li>
        <li>To make it a proper braise, make sure you don't add so much liquid (wine and beef broth) that the meat is submerged. You should still see the tops peeking out over the top.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound cremini mushrooms, halved</li>
        <li>3 medium carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, cut in half lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
        <li>3 sprigs thyme</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p></li>
        <img src="../images/braised-beef-2.webp" alt="">
        <li><p>Season beef pieces evenly on all sides with 3 1/2 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons pepper, and garlic powder.</p></li>
        <img src="../images/braised-beef-3.webp" alt="">
        <li><p>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add beef, reduce heat to medium high and cook, undisturbed until it releases easily from the skillet and a golden brown crust has formed, about 4 minutes. Flip pieces and continue to cook until browned on all sides. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.</p></li>
        <img src="../images/braised-beef-4.webp" alt="">
        <li><p>Return skillet to medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons butter to the drippings in the pan. When butter has melted add onion, mushrooms and carrots and cook 5 minutes, stirring often, scraping to release any browned bits from the bottom. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.</p></li>
        <img src="../images/braised-beef-5.webp" alt="">
        <li><p>Stir in wine and scrape to release any more bits from the pan. Return the meat to the pan, along with any accumulated juices and add thyme, bay leaves and Worcestershire.</p></li>
        <img src="../images/braised-beef-6.webp" alt="">
        <li><p>Pour in beef broth just enough that it comes up 2/3 of the way up on the beef (do not fully submerge the meat in liquid). Bring the mixture to a simmer.</p></li>
        <img src="../images/braised-beef-7.webp" alt="">
        <li><p>Cover and place in preheated oven until meat is very tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.</p></li>
        <img src="../images/braised-beef-8.webp" alt="">
        <li><p>Serve and enjoy.</p></li>
